    "-----------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "Q1. WHAT IS OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING (OOP)?\n",
    "-  OOP IS A PROGRAMMING PARADIGM, OR STYLE OF PROGRAMMING, THAT ORGANIZES SOFTWARE DESIGN AROUND DATA OR OBJECTS, RATHER THAN FUNCTIONS AND LOGIC.\n",
    "- __BENEFITS OF OOPS:-__\n",
    "    - FLEXIBILITY\n",
    "    - MODULARITY\n",
    "    - REUSABILITY\n",
    "    - MAINTAINABILITY\n",
    "- __FOR EXAMPLE:-__ YOU'RE BUILDING A LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM, SO YOU MIGHT MODEL A BOOK, A MEMBER, AND A LIBRARIAN AS OBJECTS. THE OBJECTS WILL EACH HAVE PROPERTIES AND METHODS FOR EXAMPLE, A BOOK MIGHT HAVE PROPERTIES SUCH AS A TITLE, AUTHOR, AND PUBLISHED DATE, WHILE A MEMBER HAS METHODS SUCH AS THE ABILITY TO BORROW AND RETURN BOOKS.\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "Q2. WHAT IS A CLASS IN OOP?\n",
    "-  THE CLASS IS A USER-DEFINED DATA STRUCTURE THAT COMBINES THE METHODS AND DATA MEMBERS INTO A SINGLE ENTITY.\n",
    "- CLASSES ARE SORT OF LIKE BLUEPRINTS OR TEMPLATES FOR CODE IN THE PRODUCTION OF OBJECTS.\n",
    "- YOU CAN MAKE AS MANY OBJECTS AS YOU DESIRE USING A CLASS.\n",

    "-----------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "Q3.  WHAT IS AN OBJECT IN OOP?\n",
    "-  OBJECTS ARE INSTANCES OF CLASSES.IT CONSISTS OF A SET OF METHODS AND ATTRIBUTES. ACTIONS ARE CARRIED OUT USING A CLASS'S OBJECT.\n",
    "- ANY OBJECT NEEDS TO HAVE UNIQUE IDENTIFICATION. AN ATTRIBUTE OF AN OBJECT REFLECTS BOTH THE PROPERTIES AND THE STATE OF THE OBJECT.\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "Q4. WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ABSTRACTION AND ENCAPSULATION?\n",
    "-  ABSTRACTION AND ENCAPSULATION ARE TWO FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS IN OOPS THAT WORK TOGETHER TO CREATE WELL-STRUCTURED AND MAINTAINABLE CODE. WHILE THEY ARE OFTEN USED INTERCHANGEABLY, THEY HAVE DISTINCT MEANINGS.\n",
    "- __ABSTRACTION:__\n",
    "    - ABSTRACTION FOCUSES ON HIDING IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS AIMS AT DELIVERING ONLY THE MINIMUM AMOUNT OF FUNCTIONALITY TO EASE THE USER'S INTERACTION AND AVOID COMPLICATIONS.\n",
    "    - THIS IS ACHIEVED USING ABSTRACT CLASSES, INTERFACES, AND ABSTRACT METHODS THAT DESCRIBE WHAT A SYSTEM CAN DO BUT NOT HOW IT DOES IT. IT'S JUST SEEING A CAR AS ONE PIECE WITHOUT HAVING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S INSIDE ITS PARTS.\n",
    "- __ENCAPUSATION:__\n",
    "    - ENCAPSULATION FOCUSES ON BUNDLING DATA AND METHODS WITHIN A SINGLE OBJECT ENSURES THAT THE DATA IS NOT ACCESSIBLE OR MODIFIABLE WITHOUT PROPER AUTHORIZATION, THUS MAINTAINING ITS INTEGRITY AND PRIVACY.\n",
    "    - ACCESS MODIFIERS SUCH AS PUBLIC, PRIVATE, AND PROTECTED CONTROL THE VISIBILITY. IT IS SIMILAR TO A CAPSULE THAT KEEPS THE MEDICINE SAFE AND PROTECTS IT FROM THE ENVIRONMENT.\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "Q5. WHAT ARE DUNDER METHODS IN PYTHON?\n",
    "-  DUNDER METHODS, ALSO KNOWN AS MAGIC METHODS OR SPECIAL METHODS, IN PYTHON ARE SPECIAL RESERVED METHODS THAT ARE SURROUNDED BY DOUBLE UNDERSCORES, LIKE THIS:- `__METHOD__`. THESE METHODS ALLOW YOU TO DEFINE HOW INSTANCES OF YOUR CLASSES BEHAVE WHEN THEY ARE USED WITH BUILT-IN PYTHON FUNCTIONS OR OPERATORS.\n",

    "Q7.  WHAT IS POLYMORPHISM IN OOP?\n",
    "-  IN OOP, POLYMORPHISM REFERS TO AN OBJECT'S CAPACITY TO ASSUME SEVERAL FORMS.\n",
    "SIMPLY SAID, POLYMORPHISM ENABLES US TO CARRY OUT A SINGLE ACTIVITY IN A VARIETY OF WAYS.\n",
    "- FROM THE GREEK WORDS POLY (MANY) AND MORPHISM (FORMS), WE GET POLYMORPHISM. POLYMORPHISM IS THE CAPACITY TO ASSUME SEVERAL SHAPES.\n",
    "- IN PYTHON, POLYMORPHISM IS ACHIEVED THROUGH METHOD OVERLOADING AND METHOD OVERRIDING.\n",
    "    - __METHOD OVERLOADING__ IS THE PRACTICE OF INVOKING THE SAME METHOD MORE THAN ONCE WITH DIFFERENT PARAMETERS.\n",
    "    - __METHOD OVERRIDING__ IS THE PROCESS OF PROVIDING A DIFFERENT IMPLEMENTATION FOR A METHOD THAT IS ALREADY DEFINED IN THE SUPERCLASS WITHIN A SUBCLASS.\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "Q8. HOW IS ENCAPSULATION ACHIEVED IN PYTHON?\n",
    "-  ENCAPSULATION IS A PYTHON TECHNIQUE FOR COMBINING DATA AND FUNCTIONS INTO A\n",
    "SINGLE OBJECT. A CLASS, FOR INSTANCE, CONTAINS ALL THE DATA I.E. METHODS AND VARIABLES\n",
    "- A CLASS'S DATA MEMBERS AND METHODS CAN BE MADE PRIVATE OR PROTECTED IN\n",
    "ORDER TO ACHIEVE ENCAPSULATION. DIRECT ACCESS MODIFIERS LIKE PUBLIC, PRIVATE AND PROTECTED DON'T EXIST IN PYTHON. THOUGH SINGLE AND DOUBLE UNDERSCORES CAN BE USED TO ACCOMPLISH THIS.\n",
    "\n",
    "- THE THREE DIFFERENT ACCESS MODIFIER TYPES THAT PYTHON OFFERS ARE:-\n",
    "    - __PUBLIC MEMBER:__ FROM OUTSIDE OF CLASS, ANYWHERE ACCESSIBLE.\n",
    "    - __PRIVATE MEMBER:__ WITHIN THE CLASS, ACCESSIBLE.\n",
    "    - __PROTECTED MEMBER:__ WITHIN THE CLASS AND ITS SUBCLASSES, ACCESSIBLE.\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "Q9. WHAT IS A CONSTRUCTOR IN PYTHON?\n",
    "-  A CONSTRUCTOR IS A PARTICULAR METHOD USED IN OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING TO\n",
    "GENERATE AND INITIALISE AN OBJECT OF A CLASS. IN THE CLASS, THIS METHOD IS DEFINED.\n",
    "- A CONSTRUCTOR IS A SPECIAL METHOD WITHIN A CLASS THAT IS AUTOMATICALLY CALLED WHEN AN OBJECT OF THAT CLASS IS CREATED.\n",
